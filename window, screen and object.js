"Window Objet:"
 
  The window object is the very first object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window that 
  displays the details of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents 
  of the document, the window object is created.

    Syntax: window.property_name;



"Document:"

    Document is nothing but each and every HTML elements used in the window. The document object 
    represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. By using the document object, we can access the 
    element in the HTML page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.
    
    Syntax:  document.property_name;



"Screen:"

    Screen is the loaded content displayed to user in the window. Screen is the window property that 
    holds information of browser screen. It is associated with the Window object. As like Window and 
    Document there is no such syntax for the screen. we can simply get the screen's width, height, 
    colorDepth, pixelDepth etc,.
